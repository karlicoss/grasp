* Releasing extension
** AMO (addons.mozilla.org)
: cd extension
: npm install # (if necessary)
: ./build --firefox --v2 --lint --release --publish

Note that this command will go in a busy loop waiting for the extension to be approved on AMO.
(you will see it on https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addon/grasp/versions)

- for now =v2= version of manifest is used with Firefox
- you can use =--publish=unlisted= if you want to test extension yourself first


Currently seems like it's not possible to upload the source code and notes for reviewers automatically:
