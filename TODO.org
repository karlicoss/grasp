  looks tricky...
* TODO [#C] some sort of delayed append logic? e.g. don't dump immediately and add as subitems?
* TODO [#C] or, add menu to extension?

* TODO [#C] hmm. if template is specified on client site, it's easier to dispatch todo vs non-todo etc?..
* TODO [#D] do not minfy for dev
* TODO [#D] make manifest templated so we don't have to hardcode actions

* TODO [#D] production build?
## Packing
After the development of your extension run the command

```
$ NODE_ENV=production npm run build
```
Now, the content of `build` folder will be the extension ready to be submitted to the Chrome Web Store. Just take a look at the [official guide](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/publish) to more infos about publishing.
