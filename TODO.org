: ## Packing
: After the development of your extension run the command
:
: ```
: $ NODE_ENV=production npm run build
: ```
: Now, the content of `build` folder will be the extension ready to be submitted to the Chrome Web Store. Just take a look at the [official guide](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/publish) to more infos about publishing.
